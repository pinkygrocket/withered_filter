*Every storm chaser needs a camera.*

**Withered Filter** is a small cross-compat, low-code mod* between [Cracker's Wither Storm Mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crackers-wither-storm-mod) and [Exposure](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/exposure). Specifically, it allows for Tainted Glass Panes to be used as filters in Exposure's camera, applying a special filter (post-processing shader) when used- purple tint, reduced resolution, and a trail effect. The filter's effect is most prominent with color film and fast-moving subjects or moving while the camera is active. Originally developed for Pinky's Peculiar Pack (WIP, no link yet) but someone in the Minecraft Pack Development Discord server yelled at me to make this into a standalone mod.

**Please be aware that the filter's trail effect may cause motion sickness, disorientation, or dizziness.**

CWSM and Exposure are both required as dependencies. This mod must be installed both client and server-side.

Feel free to use this in your modpack.

\* It's really just a resource pack and a tiny datapack in a trenchcoat.
